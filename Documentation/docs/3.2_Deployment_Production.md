## Static Files: Such as the header logo.

1. Set up domain name DNS records. 
2. Add required files for GitHub in repo:
    - Requirements.txt - pip freeze > requirements.txt
    - runtime.txt
    - .gitignore
    - procfile
3. Static files must be collected for the web server to grab by running python manage.py runstatic. First, you must configure the settings.py file to include:
        
        BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent

        # This is the URL used to access static files in the browser
        STATIC_URL = 'static/'

        # This is where collectstatic will put your files for production
        STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles') 

        # (Optional) If you have a local static folder in your project
        STATICFILES_DIRS = [
            os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),
        ]
4. Install and configure Middleware for serving static files such as: Whitenoise
    - Install

        pip install whitenoise

    - Update settings.py.

        'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
        'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',  # <--- Add this here

    - Update requirements.txt


    - Add compression to settings.py

        # Enables compression and caching support
        STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage'

5. Ensure DigitalOcean has this build command:

        python manage.py migrate --noinput && python manage.py collectstatic --noinput && gunicorn your_project_name.wsgi

6. For Security:
    Either update or ensure these settings in settings.py:
    - **DEBUG = False**	This is Critical because you should never go live with Debug mode on as it leaks sensitive traceback data.
    - **ALLOWED_HOSTS**	Add your domain (e.g., ['yourdomain.com', 'your-ip-address']).
5. Environment Variables	Move your SECRET_KEY and DB credentials out of settings.py and into DigitalOcean's App Platform "Environment Variables" tab.

|Key | Value (Example) | Scope | Encrypt | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|DEBUG|False| Run and Build Time | Unchecked | Helps logic during build and runtime.
|SECRET_KEY|your-very-long-random-string| Run and Build Time | Checked | This is highly sensitive; encrypt it.
|DATABASE_URL|postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname| Run and Build Time | Checked | Contains database creds.
|ALLOWED_HOSTS|"yourdomain.com,app-name.ondigitalocean.app| Run and Build Time | Unchecked | Needed for Django to accept requests.
|DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC | 0 | Build Time | Unchecked | Only needed during the build process.
6. Database	Migrations	Ensure you've run python manage.py migrate on the production database.
7. Static Files	WhiteNoise	Since Django doesn't serve static files on its own in production, most people use the WhiteNoise library to handle this easily.
8. Ensure "Force HTTPS" is toggled on in the DigitalOcean dashboard.
9. Create Droplet on Digital Ocean

## Configuring a Droplet

1. Log into Droplet via Digital Ocean terminal.
    - Digital Ocean > Droplets (side navigation pane).
    - Click **Access**.
    - Click Launch **Droplet Console** in **Droplet Console** section.
2. Update the system and install the essential system prereqs.
    - Enter into the terminal:
            sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
            sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv nginx git curl -y
3. It is best practice to keep your sites in the /var/www/ directory.
    - Set up the new project directory by entering the following into the terminal:
            git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git .
            python3 -m venv venv
            source venv/bin/activate
            pip install -r requirements.txt
            pip install gunicorn  # Ensure gunicorn is installed in the venv
