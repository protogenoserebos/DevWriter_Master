## Umbrella Article Structure

### Problem

Three different websites hosted under the same umbrella project. I am an Admin who wants to create an article for a specific site using the Django Admin Portal. I want to be able to select 'Create New Article' and create an article specific to the site. 

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Unique Models for each specific Website article type so that I can create ModelForms that will automate the forms per the model fields.
