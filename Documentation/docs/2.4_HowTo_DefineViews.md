When a URL request matches a pattern defined in urls.py, Django looks in views.py for the corresponding function. In this example, views.index in urls.py looks for the index function in views.py.

Views function calls the **render()** function which passes 2 arguments:

1. The original request object
2. Template to use to build the page.



Write **View** - URLs map to Views which retrieve and process the data needed for the page. Views render templates.
    1. Open **views.py** and add:

            from django.shortcuts import render

            def index(request):
            """The return homepage for Learning Log"""
            return render(request, 'learning_logs/index.html')
