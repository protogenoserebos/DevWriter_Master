**URL Patterns** describe the way the URL is laid out and tells Django what to look for when matching a browser request.

Url pattern is a call to the path() function that takes 3 arguments:

    urlpatterns = [
            # Homepage
            path('', views.index, name='index') ## List of individual pages in this app
        ]

1. Base URL (empty string in the above example)
2. Specifies which function to call in views.py
3. Third specifies the name for the pattern for easy reference throughout the project. 

## Initial Setup

1. Define **URL Pattern** - (**urls.py**) - 
    1. Import *include* function by adding to django.urls in **Project** directory **urls.py**. 
    >Needed to map URLs to views
                
            from django.contrib import admin
            from django.urls import path, include


    2. Include URL via path function in **Project** directory **urls.py**. 

    >The path function entered here is creating a direct link to the urls.py file that will be placed in the **application** directory.

            urlpatterns = [
            path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
            path('', include('learning_logs.urls')),
            ]

    3. Create a urls.py file in the app directory and include:
    >The . in import views tells Django to import from same directory where this urls.py file lives. 

            """Defines URL patterns for learning_logs."""

            from django.urls import path

            from . import views

            app_name = 'learning_logs'  ## distinguishes this urls.py from other apps in project

            urlpatterns = [
                # Homepage
                path('', views.index, name='index') ## List of individual pages in this app
            ]
